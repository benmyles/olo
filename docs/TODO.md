# Work list

What's left before Tabula is complete. Keep it current: strike items
as they land (with the commit), add new ones as they come up.

## Done recently

- ~~Viewer: pop-out from Quick Look, PDF forms, text, ink, signatures,
  Save / Save As / Export Flattened~~ (903ba8b, f01bff9).
- ~~Kit FilePanel~~ (903ba8b).
- ~~Preferences app~~: launcher, Appearance, Backgrounds, Display, Keyboard
  (incl. the ⌘ / Caps Lock / tap-⌘ toggles), Touchpad, Workspaces, About;
  `Cx::activate` over xdg-activation.
- ~~Power management and caffeinated mode~~: app_server turns the display
  off and sleeps when idle (Preferences ▸ Power), honours zwp_idle_inhibit,
  handles the brightness and volume keys; caffeinated mode from the Deskbar
  cup or Preferences holds a logind inhibitor. Display ▸ Brightness. ~~On-screen
  level indicator~~. ~~Keyboard backlight~~
  (keys, Preferences ▸ Keyboard, off with the display). ~~Real DPMS off~~ (CRTCs
  cleared, rendering paused until input).
- ~~Preferences ▸ Sound~~: output/input device, level, mute, live from the
  sound server (`tabula_system::audio::{devices, watch_devices, set_*}`).

## Native rule (no wrapping system tools)

- ~~nmcli, wpctl, systemctl, gsettings, dbus-update-activation-environment~~
  → `tabula-system` (NetworkManager, PulseAudio protocol with a change
  feed, logind, dconf, activation environment).

- ~~Keyboard mapping in app_server, replacing keyd~~: ⌘ as command,
  Caps Lock as Ctrl, ⌘Tab / ⌘\` switching, ⌘ arrows / ⌘⌫, tap ⌘ /
  ⌘Space for Find, terminals keep physical Ctrl (`keymap.rs`), Ctrl+⌘Q
  locks. keyd can now be disabled system-wide; while
  it runs it grabs the keyboards and app_server sees its output (handled:
  its ⌘ tap chord and Super+Tab are understood).
- ~~Kit opener instead of `xdg-open`~~: `tabula_xdg::open` (shared-mime-info
  globs + sniffing, our apps first, mimeapps.list, Exec field codes).

## Apps

- Terminal: ~~find in scrollback~~ (Edit ▸ Find…, Find Again, Find
  Selection; regex over screen and history); ~~release-build memory
  check~~ (fonts mapped, wgpu MemoryUsage: every app ~100 MB smaller);
  ~~colour emoji~~ (tabula-emoji, COLRv1 via skrifa + tiny-skia).
- ~~Activity Monitor~~: apps/activity (graphs of every /proc, /sys and
  hwmon source; processes with Quit / Force Quit).
- Preferences, remaining panels: ~~Network~~ (Wi-Fi list, join with
  password, disconnect, forget, interface details; ~~WPA-Enterprise~~: PEAP/TTLS/TLS
  sheet), ~~Bluetooth~~ (search, pair with passkey/PIN agent, connect,
  remove, battery), ~~Date & Time~~ (calendar, clock face, network
  time, time zone, Deskbar 24-hour/seconds/day), ~~Touch ID~~ (enrol with progress, remove); ~~Restart Tabula~~; ~~a Choose… file panel for the
  wallpaper~~ (app_server now draws it); ~~Display mode switching and drag-to-arrange~~ (with keep/revert
  countdown; modes and positions restored at start-up).
- ~~**StyledEdit**~~: styled text in attributes beside plain text, Font /
  Document menus, Find / Replace windows, own undo, atomic saves, reload
  keeps unsaved work.
- ~~**DeskCalc**~~: R5's keypad, Haiku's scientific rows or none; typed
  or clicked expressions (own evaluator: functions, π/e, implicit ×,
  degrees/radians), history on ↑/↓, keys flash as you type.
- ~~**Screenshot**~~: Haiku's app (screen or active window, border,
  pointer, delay, five formats, folder choice, clipboard), ⌘⇧3/⌘⇧4/⌘⇧5
  (area) and Print Screen; every backend captures.
- Web browser (native).
- Password manager: Rust 1Password SDK, passkeys, Touch ID through
  fprintd natively, browser integration.
- Viewer: ~~image zoom/pan~~ (full resolution up to the texture limit,
  View menu, pinch/⌘-scroll/double-click, drag and scroll to pan; halved
  levels for smooth fitting); ~~video playback (frames + audio)~~ (H.264 in mp4/Matroska, AV1 in
  Matroska/WebM, synced to the sound, seeking, keeps the screen awake;
  VP9, HEVC and AV1-in-mp4 still show facts only), ~~AVIF/HEIC/Opus~~.

## app_server

- **Multiple monitors, managed like macOS Displays.** Hotplug of external
  displays (USB-C/Thunderbolt on the M2), each with its own resolution,
  refresh rate, scale factor (2× default on HiDPI, 1×/1.5× etc. on
  others) and rotation; mirror or extend; choose the main display (where
  Deskbar lives). Preferences ▸ Displays shows the screens as proportional
  rectangles you drag to arrange and align (edges snap; the arrangement
  sets the global layout), with per-display settings beside them and an
  "Identify" overlay. Remembered per monitor (EDID make/model/serial) and
  restored on reconnect; a revert-in-15-seconds confirmation after mode
  changes. Windows move off a removed display; workspaces and Deskbar
  follow the main display; cursor crosses edges at matching scale.
  Done: per-output mode/refresh/scale, drag-to-arrange with snapping,
  revert countdown, saved per connector and restored at start-up,
  neighbours follow a resized screen, multi-screen headless tests.
  Rotation, the main display (Deskbar and desktop follow it, also on
  unplug) and Identify done too. ~~Settings keyed by EDID~~ (make,
  model, serial; connector entries migrate), ~~mirroring~~ (fit and centred,
  "Use as" in Preferences).

- ~~Cursor shapes~~ (Haiku's cursors via tabula-hvif, cursor-shape-v1);
  ~~night light~~ (CRTC gamma ramps, faded); ~~libinput settings~~ (touchpad tap, tap-drag, dwt, click
  method, natural scroll, speed; udev only); ~~centred alerts~~
  (`WindowOptions::alert`, set_parent, placed over the parent).

## Lock, screensaver, caffeinated

- ~~**Screen lock**~~: ext-session-lock in app_server, `tabula-lock`
  (PAM + Touch ID), Ctrl+⌘Q / Deskbar / idle display-off / sleep / logind
  Lock; never fails open; survives reload (see HACKING "The lock screen").
  Lid close goes through logind's suspend, so it is covered when the lid
  sleeps.
- ~~**Screensaver**~~: the eleven R5 modules (tabula-screensavers),
  tabula-screensaver on every output, Preferences ▸ Screen Saver (Fade and
  Modules tabs, live preview, Test, hot corners), lock-after drawing over the
  lock screen; Flip and Lens see the desktop on every backend.
- ~~**Caffeinated mode**~~: Deskbar cup (click; right-click or Tabula ▸
  Stay Awake for 1–8 hours or with the lid closed), Ctrl+⌘A, timed end,
  shown in the cup's tip and menu.

## Other

- ~~Deskbar 24-hour clock option~~ (Preferences ▸ Date & Time ▸ Clock).
- ~~**polkit authentication agent**~~: apps/polkit-agent (real sessions
  only; fprintd then password through polkit-agent-helper-1).
- ~~Icons for new file kinds~~: spreadsheet, presentation, word-document,
  pdf, font (audio, video, archive already had theirs).
- ~~Kit: asynchronous `read_clipboard`~~ (`paste` reads on a helper
  thread and delivers the Paste event through a loop channel).
